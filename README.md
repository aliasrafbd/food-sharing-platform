# üç≤ Food Sharing Platform

## üåç Project Overview
In today's world, food management is crucial. While millions of people, especially in Africa, suffer from hunger, many others waste food daily due to abundance. Our platform aims to bridge this gap in Bangladesh by enabling people to **donate food** and **request food for those in need**. Through this initiative, both the wealthy and the underprivileged can contribute to reducing food wastage and hunger.
